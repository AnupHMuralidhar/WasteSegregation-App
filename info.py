    "Great Pacific Garbage Patch": """
        **Great Pacific Garbage Patch (Ocean Garbage Patch)**
        - Latitude: 35.0000° N, Longitude: 140.0000° W
        - This is an oceanic garbage patch rather than a traditional landfill. It is one of the largest collections of debris in the world, primarily consisting of plastic waste. This patch spans an area roughly twice the size of Texas.
        - The waste is composed mainly of plastics, but includes other materials such as fishing gear and general debris.
        - AI can play a crucial role in identifying floating plastics and other materials, aiding in collection and implementing recycling strategies to reduce oceanic pollution.
